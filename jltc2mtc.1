.SH NAME
jltc2mtc \- translate LTC into MTC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jltc2mtc
[ \fIOPTIONS \fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
jltc2mtc \- JACK app to translate linear time code to midi time code.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fps\fR <num>[/den]
set expected [initial] framerate (default 25/1)
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-detectfps\fR
autodetect framerate from LTC (recommended)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-ltcport\fR <portname>
autoconnect LTC input port
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mtcport\fR <portname>
autoconnect MTC output port
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sysex\fR
send system\-excluve seek message
instead of MTC quarter frames
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.PP
This tool reads LTC from a JACK\-audio port and generates corresponding
MTC on a JACK\-midi port.
.PP
jltc2mtc supports both forward and backwards played timecode, and compensates
for decoder and port latencies.
Note that MTC only supports 4 framerates: 24, 25, 30df and 30 fps.
Framerates other than that are announced as 25fps MTC.
Drop\-frame\-timecode is detected by the corresponding bit in the LTC frame,
regardless of the \fB\-F\fR option. You can /force/ it with \fB\-f\fR 30000/1001.
.PP
Note that MTC distinguishes between film speed and video speed only by the
rate at which timecode advances, not by the information contained in the
timecode messages; thus, 29.97 fps dropframe is represented as 30 fps
dropframe with 0.1% pulldown
